# LOIF
An experimental text based game that employes massive branching and randomization:
-possible branches with noticable feature difference such as different character POV, different events, should number in the thousands.
-minor variations in terms of word usage within the larger branches should number in the millions or more.
These will be the water, interesting and dynamic to look at for a while, but after some time they may lose their charm.

What the water enables is sunken treasure, which are highly specific and fleshed out characters and plotlines which are hidden under the massive number
of possible stories. 

The player must play a kind of metagame involving fast-forwarding through many stories and adjusting what kind of choices they make in those stories
in order to have a higher chance of uncovering the sunken treasures. This will be enabled by stats which persist through different stories and branches.

The game will make use of inkjs, html and javascript. It is planned currently to be text only.
